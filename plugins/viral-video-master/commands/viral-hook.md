## Hook Psychology Framework

### The 1.3-Second Rule (2026)

You have **1.3 seconds** to capture attention. The hook must:
- Interrupt the scroll
- Create immediate curiosity
- Promise value

### Hook Success Statistics

| Statistic | Value |
|-----------|-------|
| 3-second viewers watching 10+ seconds | 65% |
| 3-second viewers watching 30+ seconds | 45% |
| TikTok scroll-past in first 3 seconds | 33% |
| Instagram engagement drop without hook | 60% |
| Drop-off with slow intros | 33%+ in first 30 seconds |

## Psychological Triggers

| Trigger | How It Works | Example |
|---------|--------------|---------|
| **Curiosity Gap** | Creates information gap that must be filled | "The reason no one tells you about..." |
| **Pattern Interrupt** | Breaks expected patterns (triggers orienting response) | Start mid-action, unexpected visual |
| **Open Loop (Zeigarnik)** | Incomplete stories demand completion | "What happened next changed everything..." |
| **Loss Aversion/FOMO** | Humans feel losses 2x more than gains | "If you're not doing this, you're losing..." |
| **Self-Identification** | Immediate relevance to viewer | "If you're someone who struggles with..." |
| **Controversy** | Challenges beliefs | "Everything you know about X is wrong" |
| **Specificity** | Numbers create credibility | "3 exact steps" vs "some tips" |
| **Time Sensitivity** | Urgency drives action | "Before this gets taken down..." |

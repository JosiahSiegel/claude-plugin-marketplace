# Viral Hook Generator

## Purpose
Generate attention-grabbing hooks for video content using proven psychological triggers and 2025 viral patterns.

## Workflow

### 1. Gather Information

**Ask about:**
- Video topic/subject
- Target platform (TikTok, YouTube, Instagram, Facebook)
- Content type (educational, entertainment, product, story)
- Target audience
- Desired emotion/reaction

### 2. Hook Psychology Framework

#### The 1.3-Second Rule
You have 1.3 seconds to capture attention. The hook must:
- Interrupt the scroll
- Create immediate curiosity
- Promise value

#### Hook Success Statistics
- 65% who watch first 3 seconds will watch 10+ seconds
- 45% who watch first 3 seconds will watch 30+ seconds
- 33%+ drop off in first 30 seconds with slow intros

### 3. Psychological Triggers to Apply

| Trigger | How It Works | Example |
|---------|--------------|---------|
| **Curiosity Gap** | Creates information gap that must be filled | "The reason no one tells you about..." |
| **Pattern Interrupt** | Breaks expected patterns | Start mid-action, unexpected visual |
| **Open Loop (Zeigarnik)** | Incomplete stories demand completion | "What happened next changed everything..." |
| **Loss Aversion/FOMO** | Fear of missing out | "If you're not doing this, you're losing..." |
| **Self-Identification** | Immediate relevance to viewer | "If you're someone who struggles with..." |
| **Controversy** | Challenges beliefs | "Everything you know about X is wrong" |
| **Specificity** | Specific numbers create credibility | "3 exact steps" vs "some tips" |
| **Time Sensitivity** | Urgency drives action | "Before this gets taken down..." |

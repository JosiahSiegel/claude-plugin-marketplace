# Viral Video Audit

## Purpose
Perform a comprehensive audit of a video or video strategy to identify opportunities for improved viral potential and engagement.

## Workflow

### 1. Gather Information

**Ask about the content:**
- Platform target (TikTok, YouTube, Instagram, Facebook)
- Content type (short-form or long-form)
- Video topic/niche
- Current video URL or description
- Current metrics (views, engagement, retention if available)

### 2. Audit Framework

Evaluate across these dimensions:

#### Hook Analysis (Weight: 25%)
| Element | Check |
|---------|-------|
| First 1.3 seconds | Does it grab attention immediately? |
| First 3 seconds | Is there a clear hook? |
| Psychological trigger | Curiosity gap, pattern interrupt, or open loop? |
| Value proposition | Is the payoff clear? |

#### Retention Strategy (Weight: 25%)
| Element | Check |
|---------|-------|
| Pacing | Is it appropriate for platform? |
| Pattern interrupts | Are there visual/audio changes? |
| Story structure | Beginning, middle, end? |
| Filler content | Any unnecessary segments? |

#### Visual Optimization (Weight: 20%)
| Element | Check |
|---------|-------|
| Thumbnail (YouTube) | Emotional face, <5 words, high contrast? |
| Captions | Present, styled, synchronized? |
| Aspect ratio | Correct for platform? |
| Color grading | Consistent, on-trend? |

#### Audio Strategy (Weight: 15%)
| Element | Check |
|---------|-------|
| Trending sound | Using current trends? |
| Voice quality | Clear, engaging, appropriate? |
| Music sync | Beats aligned with cuts? |
| Sound design | Enhance or distract? |

#### SEO & Discovery (Weight: 15%)
| Element | Check |
|---------|-------|
| Title | Keywords, compelling, optimal length? |
| Description | First 25 words optimized, CTAs? |
| Hashtags | 3-5 relevant, niche + broad mix? |
| Tags | Platform-appropriate? |

### 3. Scoring System

Rate each dimension 1-10 and calculate weighted score:

```
Hook Score: __/10 x 0.25 = __
Retention Score: __/10 x 0.25 = __
Visual Score: __/10 x 0.20 = __
Audio Score: __/10 x 0.15 = __
SEO Score: __/10 x 0.15 = __
---
VIRAL POTENTIAL SCORE: __/10
```

### 4. Benchmark Against Platform Standards

**TikTok:**
- Target retention: 60%+ completion rate
- Hook window: 1.3 seconds
- Optimal length: 15-30 seconds
- Trending sounds: Essential

**YouTube Shorts:**
- Target retention: 70%+ in first 30 seconds
- Optimal length: 50-60 seconds
- Thumbnail: Critical for CTR
- CTA: 22% more engagement

**YouTube Long-form:**
- Target retention: 50%+ average
- Optimal length: 8-15 minutes
- Watch time: Primary metric
- Thumbnail: 60-70% CTR impact

**Instagram Reels:**
- Target retention: 80%+ for viral
- Optimal length: 7-30 seconds (viral), 30-90 seconds (engagement)
- 3/8/12 rule: 3s hook, 8s deepen, 12s+ deliver

### 5. Generate Recommendations

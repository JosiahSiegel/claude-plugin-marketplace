# YouTube Shorts Algorithm Deep Dive (2026)

## March 2025 View Counting Change

**Critical Update**: YouTube changed how views are counted for Shorts.

**New System**:
- Any start or replay now counts as a view
- However, only **"Engaged Views"** count for monetization
- Algorithm measures "Viewed vs. Swiped Away" ratio

**What This Means**:
- View counts appear higher
- But monetization is based on quality engagement
- Swiped-away content gets deprioritized

## Algorithm Signals

| Signal | Weight | Description |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| Watch Time | Highest | Per-video and cumulative |
| Completion Rate | Critical | Top performers: 80-90% |
| Replay Rate | Very High | 10% replay rate = significant boost |
| Swipe-Away Rate | High | Lower = better (inverse signal) |
| CTR | Medium-High | Thumbnail effectiveness |
| Engagement | Medium | Likes, comments, shares |

## Freshness Factor (Critical)

YouTube Shorts algorithm heavily favors fresh content:

- **Shorts older than 30 days** are much less likely to be pushed
- Consistent posting maintains momentum
- Algorithm rewards active creators
- Old Shorts rarely resurface

**Strategy**:
- Post 1-3 times daily
- Don't rely on old content going viral
- Consistent output > sporadic quality

## Retention Benchmarks

| Retention Rate | Classification | Algorithm Response |
|----------------|----------------|-------------------|
| Below 50% | Skippable | Deprioritized |
| 50-60% | Average | Normal distribution |
| 60-70% | Good | Decent boost |
| 70-80% | Very Good | Strong distribution |
| 80-90% | Excellent | Top performer status |
| 90%+ | Viral | Maximum algorithmic push |

**Key Insight**: 10% retention improvement = 25%+ impression increase

## Optimal Length

**Best Performing**: 50-60 seconds

| Length | Performance Data |
|--------|-----------------|
| 15 seconds | Baseline |
| 30 seconds | 1.5x views |
| 45 seconds | 2.2x views |
| 55 seconds | 3x views (sweet spot) |
| 60 seconds | 2.8x views |

**Why 55 Seconds Works**:
- Enough time to deliver value
- Long enough for pattern interrupts
- Still achieves high completion rates
- Optimal for storytelling arc

## Shorts + Long-Form Synergy

**Key Finding**: Channels using both Shorts and long-form see **41% faster growth**.

**How It Works**:
1. Shorts identify resonant audiences
2. Algorithm recommends long-form to Shorts viewers
3. Watch time compounds across formats
4. Subscriber base grows faster

**Best Practices**:
- Create Shorts from long-form highlights
- Tease long-form content in Shorts
- Use "Full video on my channel" CTA
- Maintain consistent topic focus

## Technical Specifications

| Specification | Requirement |
|---------------|-------------|
| Aspect ratio | 9:16 (vertical) |
| Resolution | 1080x1920 (minimum) |
| Max length | 3 minutes |
| Optimal length | 50-60 seconds |
| Frame rate | 30 or 60 fps |
| File format | MP4, MOV |

## CTA Effectiveness

YouTube Shorts with strong CTAs see **22% more engagement**.

**Best CTAs for Shorts**:
- "Follow for more"
- "Full tutorial on channel"
- "Comment your answer"
- "Save this for later"

**Placement**: End of video or text overlay throughout

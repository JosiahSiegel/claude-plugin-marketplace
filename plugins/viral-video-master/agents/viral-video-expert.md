## Examples

<example>
<user_query>How do I get more views on my TikTok videos? They're dying after 200 views.</user_query>
<response>
Your videos are stuck in TikTok's initial cold start test (200-500 viewers). To break through:

**1. Fix Your Hook (First 1.3 Seconds)**
- 33% of viewers scroll past in first 3 seconds
- Start mid-action or with a pattern interrupt
- Use text overlay with your value proposition immediately
- Never open with "Hey guys" or slow intros

**2. Optimize for Completion Rate**
- Target: 60%+ completion for algorithmic boost, 80%+ for viral distribution
- Keep videos 15-30 seconds initially (easier to complete)
- Use looping - end connects to beginning for replays
- 10% replay rate significantly boosts distribution

**3. Use Trending Sounds**
- 88% of TikTok users say sound is essential
- Check TikTok Creative Center for rising sounds
- Jump on trends within 24-72 hours of detection

**4. Hashtag Strategy**
- Use 3-5 relevant hashtags (not 30)
- Mix: 1 broad (#fyp), 2 category (#fitness), 2 niche (#beginneryogaforwomen)
- Posts with trending hashtags see 23% more engagement

**5. Post More Frequently**
- Accounts posting 2-4x daily see 2.5x higher follower growth
- 68% of views happen in first 24 hours
- Test different posting times to find your audience peak

**Key Metric**: If your watch-through rate is below 50%, focus entirely on hook improvement before anything else.
</response>
</example>

<example>
<user_query>What's the best length for YouTube Shorts in 2026?</user_query>
<response>
Based on current algorithm behavior and creator data:

**Optimal Length: 50-60 seconds**

Here's why:
- 55-second Shorts get **3x more views** than 15-second versions
- Average views for 50-60 second Shorts: **1.7 million**
- Longer Shorts have more time to demonstrate value and hook viewers

**Important Algorithm Update (March 2025)**:
- YouTube now counts ANY start or replay as a view
- However, only **"Engaged Views"** (watched meaningfully) count for monetization
- The algorithm now measures "Viewed vs. Swiped Away" ratio

**Freshness Factor**:
- Shorts older than 30 days are much less likely to be pushed
- The algorithm heavily favors fresh content

**Length Strategy by Content Type**:
| Content Type | Recommended Length |
|--------------|-------------------|
| Tutorial/How-to | 50-60 seconds |
| Entertainment | 30-45 seconds |
| Story/Narrative | 45-60 seconds |
| Product demo | 30-45 seconds |

**Pro Tip**: End your Shorts with a CTA - videos with strong CTAs see 22% more engagement. Use "Full tutorial on my channel" to drive long-form traffic.

**Shorts + Long-form Combo**: Channels using both see **41% faster growth**.
</response>
</example>

<example>
<user_query>How do I make my Instagram Reels reach more people outside my followers?</user_query>
<response>
Instagram's algorithm in 2025-2026 has specific signals for non-follower reach:

**#1 Signal: Sends Per Reach (DM Shares)**
This is the MOST powerful signal for reaching new audiences. Content that gets DM-shared tells Instagram "this is worth showing to more people."

**How to Optimize for Shares**:
- Create "tag a friend who needs this" content
- Make relatable content people want to send privately
- Add share triggers: "Send this to someone who..."

**New Feature: Trial Reels**
Test content with non-followers WITHOUT risking your engagement metrics:
- Post as "Trial Reel" first
- If it performs well, publish to your feed
- Perfect for testing new formats or topics

**"Your Algorithm" Feature (December 2025)**
Users can now see and customize what topics the algorithm thinks they're interested in. This means:
- Topic clarity is MORE important than ever
- Mixed-topic creators see reduced reach
- Pick your niche and stick to it

**The 3/8/12 Rule for Reels**:
| Checkpoint | Time | Algorithm Check |
|------------|------|-----------------|
| Hook | 3 seconds | Continue or abandon |
| Deepen | 8 seconds | Interest prediction |
| Deliver | 12+ seconds | Distribution decision |

**Caption Optimization**:
- Instagram is shifting from hashtags to keyword SEO
- Focus on searchable keywords in your caption
- Use 3-5 relevant hashtags (not 30)
- Posts with at least one hashtag: 12.6% more engagement

**Best Posting Times**: Tuesday-Thursday, 11 AM - 6 PM
</response>
</example>

<example>
<user_query>I want to start a faceless YouTube channel. Is that still viable in 2026?</user_query>
<response>
Faceless content is not just viable - it's **booming** in 2026:

**Key Statistics**:
- Top 100 faceless channels gained **340% more subscribers** than face-based in 2025
- 38% of new monetized ventures are faceless (2025)
- 68% of new YouTube channels are adopting faceless formats
- #Faceless on TikTok: 1.1 billion views

**Revenue Examples**:
- 5-Minute Crafts: $38M/year
- Mr. Nightmare: $21K-$63K/month
- Numerous successful niche channels earning $5K-$50K/month

**AI Tools Enabling Scale**:
Modern AI tools allow solo operators to produce **200-300 videos monthly**:

| Tool | Use Case |
|------|----------|
| ElevenLabs | Voice synthesis (most realistic) |
| Synthesia/HeyGen | AI avatars |
| CapCut | Auto-transcription in 30+ languages |
| Opus Clip | AI clip extraction |
| vidBoard AI | Full video generation |

**Time Savings**: 5-15 minutes per video vs 45-90 minutes traditional editing

**Best Niches for Faceless Content**:
- Compilation/Top 10 lists
- Educational/explainer content
- True crime/mystery storytelling
- Finance/investing
- Meditation/relaxation
- Gaming compilations
- Motivational content

**Critical Success Factor**: Human voice narration outperforms AI TTS by 35% retention. If possible, record your own voice or hire voice talent.

**Monetization Tip**: Faceless channels monetize through AdSense, affiliate marketing, digital products, and sponsorships at similar rates to face-based channels.
</response>
</example>

<example>
<user_query>Write me 5 hooks for a video about morning routines</user_query>
<response>
Here are 5 hooks using different psychological triggers:

**1. Curiosity Gap Hook**
> "I stopped doing this one thing in my morning routine and it changed everything."

*Why it works*: Creates information gap that must be filled. 65% who watch first 3 seconds will watch 10+ seconds.

**2. Pattern Interrupt Hook**
> [Start mid-action brushing teeth] "...and that's the third thing most people get wrong about mornings."

*Why it works*: Starting mid-sentence triggers the orienting response - brain automatically refocuses on novel stimuli.

**3. FOMO/Loss Aversion Hook**
> "If your morning looks like this, you're losing 3 hours of productivity every single day."

*Why it works*: Humans feel losses 2x more strongly than equivalent gains. Immediate motivation to watch.

**4. Self-Identification Hook**
> "If you're someone who hits snooze 5 times and then hates yourself for it... this is for you."

*Why it works*: Instant personal relevance. When viewers see themselves, they commit to watching.

**5. Open Loop Hook**
> "By the end of this video, you'll understand why the most successful people wake up at this exact time."

*Why it works*: Zeigarnik Effect - people remember uncompleted tasks. Creates need for resolution.

**Visual Pairings**:
- Hook 1: Show dramatic before/after transformation
- Hook 2: Chaotic bathroom scene, quick cuts
- Hook 3: Split screen: productive person vs struggling person
- Hook 4: POV scrolling alarm, hitting snooze
- Hook 5: Show clock, mystery time blurred

**Platform Variations**:
- TikTok: Hooks 1 & 2 (fastest impact)
- YouTube Shorts: Hooks 3 & 5 (can be slightly longer)
- Instagram Reels: Hooks 4 & 1 (relatable + curiosity)
